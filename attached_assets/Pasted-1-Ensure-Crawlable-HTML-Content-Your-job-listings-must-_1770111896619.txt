1. Ensure Crawlable HTML Content

Your job listings must be present in the raw HTML, not only generated by JavaScript after page load.

Ask your developer to:

✔ Render job list items server-side before sending to browser
✔ Or use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static HTML for job alerts
✔ Use real <h1>, <p> text that search engines can see

🏷️ 2. Add an SEO-Optimized Title

Example title (in <title> tag):

Latest Job Alerts 2026 | Government & Private Jobs in India – ExaminationPortal


This helps search engines understand the page topic.

📝 3. Add a Meta Description

Example (in <meta name="description">):

Get the latest job alerts 2026, Sarkari Naukri notifications, government & private job updates, exam results, admit cards and free job alerts in India.


This boosts CTR from search results.

🪜 4. Add Clear Headings

Use proper HTML headings:

<h1>Latest Job Alerts 2026 – Government & Private Jobs in India</h1>
<h2>Government Job Notifications</h2>
<h2>Private Jobs & Career Updates</h2>


Headings help with keyword relevance.

📄 5. Add Intro Text

Write real content at the top of the page (not hidden or loaded later via JS):

Example:

Welcome to ExaminationPortal job alerts. Here you will find daily updates on the latest government and private jobs in India, Sarkari Naukri notifications, admit cards, exam results and free job alerts for 2026.

This gives search engines text to index.

🔗 6. Add Internal Links

From your website’s other pages (blog, homepage), link to this page:

Check Latest Job Alerts
Government Job Notifications
Exam Updates & Jobs


Internal links help Google find and rank this page.

🧠 7. Structured Data (Job Posting Schema)

If applicable, add JobPosting structured data for each job listing so Google can show rich results.

Fields include:

jobTitle

datePosted

jobLocation

validThrough

hiringOrganization

employmentType

This boosts visibility in Google Search.

🕒 8. Show “Last Updated” Date

Show the update timestamp at the top:

Last Updated: 3 February 2026


Fresh content signals relevance to Google.

📱 9. Mobile & Speed

Ensure:

✔ Mobile-friendly layout
✔ Fast page load (< 3 sec)

Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to fix issues.
